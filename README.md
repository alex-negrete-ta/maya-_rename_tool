# maya-_rename_tool
This Maya UI grabs the selected objects and names them based on the specifications of the department and type.

It works with type_name_descriptor_subsubtype_grp

type: is the type of selection you grabbed, geo, lighting department, or control group.
The variable is listed to be added to more departments or fewer based on production needs.

name: the name you input to rename the object.

descriptor: What is for, character object, environment, or prop

subtype: sometimes in lighting or rigging, you need to describe the position (left, right, up, etc.)

group: is only added if what you are renaming is a group.
